        <div id="firstText">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics,
            philosophy, and
            metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</div>

            <h2 id="secondTitle">Big Bang Theory</h2>
            <div id="secondText">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The
                Big Bang
                theory
                suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a
                result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the
                cosmos.</div>

                <div id="textOfHoleTheory">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions
                    where gravity is so
                    intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can
                    emit radiation.</div>

                <div id="stringText">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical
                    world. According to
                    this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional
                    microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                    different sizes and characteristics.</div>

                        single framework that
                        explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</div>

                        theory proposes the
                        existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing
                        the laws of physics.</div>

                        not point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different
                        frequencies, with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</div>
